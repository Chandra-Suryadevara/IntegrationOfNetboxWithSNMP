# IntegrationOfNetboxWithSNMP

Title: Netbox SNMP Integration

Description:
The Netbox SNMP Integration Repository provides a seamless integration between Netbox, an open-source web application designed for managing and documenting computer networks, and SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), a standard protocol for monitoring and managing network devices. This repository automates the process of retrieving SNMP walk port descriptions from switches and posting them into Netbox, streamlining the network documentation and management workflow.

Key Features:
1. SNMP Walk Port Description Retrieval: The repository facilitates the retrieval of SNMP walk port descriptions from switches deployed in the network infrastructure. By utilizing SNMP, it accesses detailed information about each port, including its description, status, and configuration.

2. Netbox Integration: It seamlessly integrates with Netbox, enabling the automatic population of port descriptions obtained through SNMP walks into the Netbox database. This ensures that the network documentation in Netbox remains up-to-date and accurate without manual intervention.

3. Automation: The repository is designed to automate the entire process of retrieving SNMP walk data and updating port descriptions in Netbox. This reduces the burden on network administrators and eliminates the possibility of human error in maintaining network documentation.

4. Enhanced Network Visibility: By synchronizing SNMP walk data with Netbox, the repository enhances network visibility and facilitates better network management. Network administrators can easily identify ports, track their status, and troubleshoot issues efficiently.

5. Customization and Extensibility: The repository offers customization options to adapt to different network environments and requirements. Users can configure parameters such as SNMP community strings, polling intervals, and SNMP OID (Object Identifier) filters to tailor the integration according to their specific needs.

Overall, the Netbox SNMP Integration Repository serves as a valuable tool for network administrators seeking to streamline network documentation and management processes by leveraging SNMP data within the Netbox platform. By automating the retrieval and synchronization of port descriptions, it enhances network visibility, efficiency, and reliability.
